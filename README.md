# b0Shimming Project 5th year Masters

Working to simulate and show that it is possible to correct for b0 inhomogeneity
caused by a TMS coil using a headcap of flexible and conforming RF coils 
designed by Julian Maravilla. They have been modified to be AC/DC.

* Contains modifications on code initially by Jacob White, Nicolas Arango, and Irene Kuang at MIT, "who have developed a low-cost 8-channel digitally-programmable current driver that can supply up to 8 amps DC per channel (up to 60 volt output). The circuit board design and control software were created by Nicolas Arango and Irene Kuang." More info can be found [here](https://rflab.martinos.org/index.php/Current_driver:Current_driver)
